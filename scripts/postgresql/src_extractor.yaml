  #ddl-replication:
    # This config enables detection of DDLs fire on source. Supported values are true/false.   
  #  enable: true       
    # Default is REINIT mode. Supported modes REINIT and INLINE.
    # INLINE MODE : We will parse cdc logs generated by source and apply them to target.
    # If we are not able to parse ddl or target does not support a particular ddl then we fall back to the REINIT method and do reinitialization of that table.
    # REINIT MODE : After every x seconds (governed by detect-ddl-interval config below) we will fetch schemas from source and compare with target to detect DDLs.
    # Once the ddl is detected, the table needs to be reinitialized. If REINIT mode is used please set skip-tables-on-failures: true in applier config.
    # NOTES:
    #   Postgres: REINIT supported
    #             INLINE NOT supported
  #  ddl-replication-mode: REINIT 
    # This config sets the value of DDL detection interval in seconds E.g if set to 600 then DDLs will be detected after every 600 seconds.
    # This is only used when ddl-replication-mode is REINT. If DDLs are rare it is recommended to set large value.    
  #  detect-ddl-interval: 600
